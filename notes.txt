Through My Eyes: Heritage, Home, and Pride

Welcome to Mexico, a place with so much spirit. A spirit that has come from its past , pride and a little bit of stubbornness. You will exhibit it’s spirit everywhere, such as in it’s architecture, food, entertainment, and most especially in it’s diversity of people.
I always have seen Mexico as just another country with some ties, through family, nothing too extraordinary. But I grew into and adult and have been fortunate to be able to visit more places in Mexico. Today I see Mexico so much differently, as if I was asleep and I have woken up to find a new adventures magical place .
I admit I do have and an agenda. My intention is to show you my perspective of Mexico and hope  for you find yourself enjoying and learning a new understanding to also gain a new perspective of Mexico, as I did.  I wish to convince you to one day plan on seeing Mexico’s beauty for yourselves, because I believe once you see Mexico for yourselves it will be convincing enough to fall in love with it’s beauty.
I do want to throwout a small caution. People visit Mexico from all four corners of the world, but many of times end up falling in love with it’s magical beauty that they end up staying and making it their new home away from home.
So please, let me show you how special Mexico can be, through my eyes; as a the son of the U.S and father roots of Mexico.... Enjoy Amigos!
